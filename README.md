# Best places to live and work in the U.S.
I'm in my second year of undergrad, so naturally I've been thinking a lot about where to live once I graduate. In this project, I will explore data to augment my decision making. This project was heavily inspired by the list of best places to live by [U.S. Real Estate News](https://realestate.usnews.com/places/rankings/best-places-to-live). Their list is very compelling, and I was curious about their methods. I also found it difficult to compare two cities. So I decided to jump in myself!

## Problem definition
What's the best U.S. city to live and work in? I'll look at climate, population, and economy, as well as other factors that might be subjective and hard to measure (such as recreation, culture, religiosity, sports-ness, and political distribution). The focus of this experiment, compared to the U.S Real Estate News list is:
* Make it easier to compare two or more cities against any parameter or a set of parameters
* Consider how things are changing (e.g. 'What will the cost of living be in 10 years?' instead of 'What is the cost of living now?')
* Investigate other factors that are not covered by U.S. Real Estate News
